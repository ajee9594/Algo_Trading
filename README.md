# Algo_Trading

Welcome to the Algo_Trading repository! This repository contains code related to the setup of an Automated High-Frequency Trading system. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about algorithmic trading or an experienced trader seeking to automate your strategies, you'll find valuable resources here.  

**Note:** In this repository ***FyersAPI*** has been used. To integrate with any other broker's API, change the required parts with the code given by the broker in their API Documentation.  

**Warning:** The codes **should not** be directly deployed into markets with real money. The purpose of this Repository is to provide a ready to use template which can be used to set up very advanced HFT system.
